# Understanding Self-Rolled Tools

- Self-rolled tools refer to the practice of creating your own custom solutions for managing critical aspects of your cryptocurrency security. This can involve developing your own private key management systems, custom key handlers, and even proprietary cryptography functions.

# Exploring Alternative Self-Tool Implementations

Beyond developing complex software, "self-tooling" can also manifest in simpler, albeit still risky, forms:

- Brain Wallet: This method involves committing a private key or seed phrase entirely to memory, with no physical or digital backup. The security relies solely on the user's ability to recall the information perfectly.

- Paper Wallet: A user meticulously writes down their private key on a piece of paper. This single physical copy is then stored in a highly secure location, such as a safe deposit box. The integrity of the funds depends entirely on the security and preservation of this one document.

- Self-encryption Tools: This involves a user creating their own encryption utilities or custom password managers. These bespoke tools are then used to encrypt private keys or to authorize transactions, adding a personalized layer of security before interacting with the blockchain.

# Case Study: An Advanced Self-Tool Setup for High-Stakes Scenarios

To illustrate the extent to which individuals might go when employing self-tools, especially when substantial wealth is involved, consider this real-world example based on an acquaintance operating under a specific threat model:

- Distributed Holdings: Hundreds of individual wallets were created, each holding relatively small amounts of cryptocurrency to minimize the impact of any single wallet compromise.

- Redundant Backups: Multiple backups of critical information were maintained, physically stored in geographically distinct, secure locations.

- Tiered Storage: Approximately ten "main" wallets were designated to hold the majority of the funds, likely with even more stringent security measures.

- Zero Trust in Standard Solutions: This individual explicitly avoided all standard hardware or browser wallets, relying entirely on their custom-built systems.

- Proprietary Key Generation: Secret phrases and private keys were generated using tools developed in-house.

- Layered Encryption: Each private key was individually encrypted using their custom methods.

- Secure Physical Storage: The encrypted keys were then stored in a secret, custom-built database, which itself was kept on a select few air-gapped hard drives.

- Pseudo Social Recovery Mechanism: These hard drives were entrusted to trusted individuals who were unaware of the contents or how to decrypt them. This introduced a form of social recovery, where access required cooperation, but knowledge remained siloed.

- Regular Rotation: Crucially, every six months, all funds were systematically rotated to entirely new wallets, invalidating old keys and further complicating any potential attack.

This elaborate setup highlights the dedication and complexity that can be involved when one decides to take full, personal responsibility for every aspect of their digital asset security.
